# Robotic-Arm
Brief description: 
The project 3D Robotic Helper Arm aims to help the elderly using Internet of Things and robotics concept. We have build a robot that has a carrier attached to it that will follow the old people to carry their day to day belongings. And an addition arm to pick up things that have fallen. The carrier robot uses Arduino and motion sensors while the arm uses servo motors and an Arduino as well. The capacity of the carrier is around 500gms and for the arm 500gms approximately.

USP: Target Following Device 
Our project Target following device, was designed as an object  carrier especially for the people who are not capable of carrying weighted objects. Our project component comprises sensors which could detect the person to whom our device is following. As the person moves ahead this device would follow the foot and could carry their luggage and belongings along with it.
